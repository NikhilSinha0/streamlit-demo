# ns380-wk9-miniproject

This project creates a chatbot with streamlit where you provide a passage (ideally one from Wikipedia or a similar factual source), then chat with the assistant asking questions
about the passage. 

The underlying LLM in question is Intel's TinyBERT model, which is based on the original Google BERT model. The Intel model is available with the Apache 2.0
license, making it available for use in this context.

The app is then served using Streamlit Cloud.
